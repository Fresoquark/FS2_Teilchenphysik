\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:diskussion}

The comparison of the unfolding methods Naive SVD and Poisson-Likelihood
demonstrates that similar results can be achieved using either one. The flux
calculation shows almost perfect agreement between the two methods in the first
four bins. Only in the last bin, a larger uncertainty in both methods as well as
a lager discrepancy compared to the other bins is noticable. This may be
related to the fact, that this bin contains fewer entries and therefore rises
larger uncertainties when calculating the error on the bin. \par

Comparing the unfolded data from this course to HERA and MAGIC results, very good
agreement to the HERA results and good agreement to the MAGIC results can be
found. Both curves lie well within the uncertainty of the unfolded data except
for the first bin, for which MAGIC does no longer fit within the uncertainty.
All in all though it can be said, that the unfolded data fits well with the
results from the other collaborations. \par

Systematic uncertainties may arise from detector simulation or the cut on
the theta-value, but seeing the agreement of the data to results from other
collaborations, these uncertainties will be minor.
