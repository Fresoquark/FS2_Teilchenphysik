\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:durch}
First a data selection is implemented 
including only events which have a probabilty of at least $\SI{80}{\percent}$ to
originate from a gamma-ray.
Only the events with an angular distance to the positionof the source of $\theta^2 \leq \num{0.025}$ are taken into consideration.
Afterwards, a theta-squared plot is made and the detector significance is calculated.
Then, the migration matrix of the random-forest-regressor with the estimated and true gamma energies in an 
energy range from $\SI{500}{\giga\electronvolt}$ to $\SI{15}{\tera\electronvolt}$ is created. \par

Then, the unfolding for the crab nebula measurement with the naive SVD and the poisson-likelihood method is done.
At last, the calculated flux for the unfolded data is compared to the HERA and MAGIC measurements.
